					i want to use this community page from the sidebar to add in a socket
					chat system where users are completely free to waste time, take the
					piss and entertain eachother.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea of including this in a project management application is that
					the team involved will on occasion want to share their personality and
					humor / updates. Naturally, this would be a much happier work
					enviroment. especially if it is remote work where the human connection
					is really lost in most cases.
